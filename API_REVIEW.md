## Missing Endpoints in Implemented Resources

### Stories (Missing 13/22 endpoints)
- ❌ Bulk create: `POST /api/v3/stories/bulk`
- ❌ Bulk update: `PUT /api/v3/stories/bulk`
- ❌ Bulk delete: `DELETE /api/v3/stories/bulk`
- ❌ Create from template: `POST /api/v3/stories/from-template`
- ❌ Story history: `GET /api/v3/stories/{id}/history`
- ❌ All comment operations (5 endpoints)
- ❌ All task operations (3 endpoints)

### Epics (Missing 11/17 endpoints)
- ❌ Paginated list: `GET /api/v3/epics/paginated`
- ❌ Related stories: `GET /api/v3/epics/{id}/stories`
- ❌ All comment operations (5 endpoints)
- ❌ Health tracking operations (3 endpoints)
- ❌ Productboard unlink: `POST /api/v3/epics/{id}/unlink-productboard`

### Search (Missing 5/6 endpoints)
- ✅ Search stories (implemented)
- ❌ General search: `GET /api/v3/search`
- ❌ Search epics: `GET /api/v3/search/epics`
- ❌ Search iterations: `GET /api/v3/search/iterations`
- ❌ Search milestones: `GET /api/v3/search/milestones`
- ❌ Search objectives: `GET /api/v3/search/objectives`

### Projects (Missing 1/6 endpoints)
- ❌ List project stories: `GET /api/v3/projects/{id}/stories`

### Labels (Missing 1/7 endpoints)
- ❌ Update label: `PUT /api/v3/labels/{id}`

### Iterations (Missing 2/8 endpoints)
- ❌ List disabled iterations: `GET /api/v3/iterations/disabled`
- ❌ List enabled iterations: `GET /api/v3/iterations/enabled`

## Model Issues

### 1. Missing `from_json` Methods
Many models lack the `from_json` classmethod for deserialization:
- ❌ Label, WorkflowState, Member, Group
- ❌ File, LinkedFiles, Repository
- ❌ Category, Objective, KeyResult
- ❌ Most input models (StoryInput, CreateGroupInput, etc.)

### 2. Inconsistent Field Types
- Story model has many fields as `Optional[Any]` that should be specific types
- Missing proper datetime parsing in `from_json` methods
- Some IDs are strings (UUIDs) while others are integers

### 3. Missing Models
- ❌ Milestone, MilestoneInput
- ❌ StoryComment, CreateStoryComment
- ❌ Task, CreateTask
- ❌ CustomField, CustomFieldValue
- ❌ EntityTemplate
- ❌ Integration
- ❌ Bulk operation models

## API Design Issues

### 1. Inconsistent Method Signatures
- `delete_story` accepts a Story object instead of ID (inconsistent with other delete methods)
- `create_project` missing type hint for params parameter

### 2. Missing Features
- No pagination support (API supports it for epics, stories)
- No bulk operations support
- No request retry logic or rate limiting
- No async/await support
- No response caching

### 3. Error Handling
- Basic error handling with `raise_for_status()`
- No custom exceptions for different error types
- No detailed error messages from API responses

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Add missing `from_json` methods to all models
2. Implement story comments and tasks endpoints
3. Add bulk operations for stories
4. Fix `delete_story` to accept ID instead of object
5. Add proper error handling with custom exceptions

### Medium Priority
1. Implement pagination support
2. Add missing search endpoints
3. Implement milestones resource
4. Add story history endpoint
5. Update all models to use proper field types

### Low Priority
1. Add entity templates support
2. Implement custom fields
3. Add integrations management
4. Implement health check endpoint
5. Add async/await support

## Usage Impact
The current client covers approximately 60% of the API surface area, focusing on core functionality. However, it misses several important features like comments, tasks, bulk operations, and advanced search capabilities that would significantly enhance its usefulness for complex project management scenarios.
