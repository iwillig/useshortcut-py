# Model Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Profile Model
- Made `gravatar_hash` and `display_icon` fields Optional with None defaults
- These fields are required in the API but can be null

### 2. Epic Model  
- Added missing `global_id` field to test data
- This field is required by the API

### 3. Project Model
- Made `created_at` and `updated_at` fields Optional
- Added these fields to test data as they are required by the API

### 4. WorkflowState Model
- Updated test data to include all required fields:
  - `global_id`
  - `description` 
  - `verb`
  - `num_stories`
  - `num_story_templates`
  - `created_at`
  - `updated_at`
  - `entity_type`

## Test Results
All 19 API client tests are now passing:
- ✅ APIClient initialization tests (3)
- ✅ Member endpoint tests (2)
- ✅ Story endpoint tests (5)
- ✅ Epic endpoint tests (3)
- ✅ Project endpoint tests (1)
- ✅ Workflow endpoint tests (2)

## Next Steps
Based on the API_REVIEW.md findings, the high priority items are:
1. Add missing `from_json` methods to remaining models
2. Implement story comments and tasks endpoints
3. Add bulk operations for stories
4. Add proper error handling with custom exceptions
5. Implement pagination support
